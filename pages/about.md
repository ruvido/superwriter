Nothing special happens, **no particular emotion**, but everything simply seems to be in the right place. With my eyes closed I address my heart and my spirit to God, full of confidence in Him, I let myself be emptied so as to [give space to the Lord](), the one who is.   It lasts just half an hour: when the alarm sounds again I prepare an orange juice and look to wake up the rest of the crew.   And then like a fixed schedule the whole day starts: dressing up, pack the backpacks, take the children to school and so forth.
